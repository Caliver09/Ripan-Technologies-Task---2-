Description:- The Ticket Booking System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the booking and
management of tickets for various events or services, such as concerts, movies, or travel.
The objective is to build an intuitive, efficient, and feature-rich platform that allows users to
view available options, book tickets, and manage their reservations. It will add the event details and the available tickets for the respective event, and after booking of the tickets of the respective events it will show how much tickets have been left. In this project i've also added a feature for toggling between the light/dark mode.

Technologies Used:- HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap

This Ticket Booking System is built using HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and LocalStorage. It features three main sections:
Events Tab – Displays available events dynamically.
Booking Tab – Allows users to select an event and book tickets, updating availability.
Admin Panel – Enables event creation, updating, and deletion.

Key Features includes the following:
Dark Mode Toggle – Switches between light and dark themes.
LocalStorage Persistence – Events and bookings are stored locally.

This lightweight system efficiently manages event bookings with a simple, user-friendly interface.
